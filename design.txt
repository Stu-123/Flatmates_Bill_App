Title: Flatmates Billing App

Description: An app that gets as input the amount of a bill for a particular period and
the days that each of the flatmates stayed in the house for that period and returns
how much each flatmate has to pay. It also generates a PDF report stating the names
of the flatmates, the period, and how much each of them had to pay.

Objects:

Bill:
    amount
    period (e.g. how many months is the bill for?)
    due_date

Flatmate:
    name (should be unique)
    days_in_house (time spent in the house is used to calculate the overall bill)
    pays(bill)

PDFReport:
    filename
    generate(flatmate_1, flatmate_2, bill)

This can change later, but it's useful to outline what classes and methods you will need.
